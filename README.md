# Shopping_Cart

This app is part of an exercise included in the MIT xPRO full stack developer program. It simulates an online shop offering the following functionality:

- add items to your basket
- remove items from your basket
- keeps track of the total price
- prevents adding items to the basket when run out of stock
- restock all items to a predefined value (interaction with a strapi data base)
